BasicWPTheme
============

### Generic Wordpress Theme ###

BasicWPTheme is a generic starter template for Custom WP Theme development. The theme comes packaged with an assets folder, all the basic template types for specialized content, and can run LESS files when WP-LESS is installed. 

To install, simply clone down into you local directory, move the files into a appropriately named theme folder, (if you care), and then upload into ```wp-content``` via your favorite flavor of FTP/SFTP etc.
